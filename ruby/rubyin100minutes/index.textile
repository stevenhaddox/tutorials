h2. Ruby History

Ruby is thought of by many as a "new" programming language, but it actually was released in 1994 by a developer known as Matz.  Matz is a self-described "language geek" and was a particularly big fan of Perl.  His idea for Ruby was to create a language that was flexible and powerful like Perl, but more expressive in its syntax -- even pushing towards English-like readability.

Ruby was released in '94 and it grew an audience quickly -- in Japan.  Until 2000 there really wasn't any documentation about the language that wasn't in Japanese, so if you wanted to learn Ruby you were pretty much on your own.  Dave Thomas, a pioneer of agile programming, became enamored with Ruby and decided to create that documentation.  He wrote what's affectionately known as "The Pickaxe", due to it's cover image, which opened Ruby to the English-speaking world.

From there Ruby started growing, though slowly.  It because popular with system administrators to write maintenance and "glue" scripts -- the kinds of things Perl had been used for.  The US Ruby community numbered in the hundreds from 2000-2005.

In 2004-2005 a Chicago company named 37Signals hired a young CS student to build a web application.  They gave him almost total freedom for the implementation; they were only concerned with the design and functionality from the client-side.  At the time the predominant web technologies were PHP, Java's JSP, and Microsoft's ASP.  They were each somewhat painful, so David, today known as DHH, went his own direction.

He wrote the application is Ruby.  He relied on the core language and a handful of helper libraries, but more-or-less created the entire stack himself.  He and 37Signals worked on the web app, today known as Basecamp, and released it.

Then, once Basecame was built, DHH extracted the web framework out of it.  This was a very different approach from Java or Microsoft where the web frameworks were handed down from on high and the "real world" had to adapt.  Instead, Rails was extracted from the real world.  It tried to solve only the necessary problems and defer developing features until they were necessary.

That approach was a big hit and Rails has powered the growth of the Ruby community ever since.  Now we have pages and pages of books on Amazon, dozens of conferences around the world, and thousands of people employed as Ruby/Rails developers at organizations like AT&T, NASA, Google, and GroupOn.

And if you want to learn Rails, you need to learn Ruby first!  Here goes...

h2. 1. Instructions & Interpreters

There are two ways to run Ruby code.  You can write one or more instructions in a file then run that file through the Ruby interpreter.  When you're writing a "real" program, this is the way to do it.  We might have a file named @my_program.rb@ like this:

<pre class="brush:ruby">
  class Sample
    def hello
      puts "Hello, World!"
    end
  end
  
  s = Sample.new
  s.hello
</pre>

Then we could run the program like this:

<pre class="console">
  ruby my_program.rb
</pre>

Ruby is called a scripting language or an interpreted language because it doesn't run on the computer's hardware directly, it first goes through the Ruby interpreter.  When you run *ruby my_program.rb* you're actually loading the *ruby* program which in turn loads your *my_program.rb*.

The second option is to use the Interactive RuBy shell -- IRB.  When I'm programming I always have IRB open.  IRB has all the same features as the regular Ruby interpreter, but it allows you to easily evaluate one or a handful of instructions and instantly see their results.  I use IRB mostly for experimenting.  In a regular program I might write a hundred lines of instructions.  But if there's one thing I'm not sure about I'll flip over to IRB to test it out.  Start IRB by opening a Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Win) and typing @irb@.

h2. 2. Variables

Everything needs a name so we can refer to it.  A variable, like in math, is just a name for a piece of data.  In Ruby variables are very flexible and can be changed at any time.  Variables are assigned using a single equals sign (@=@) where the *right* side of the equals sign is evaluated first, then the value is assigned to the variable named on the *left* side of the equals.  Go into IRB, enter in these example instructions, and observe the output that Ruby gives you back:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
a = 5
b = 10 + 5
c = 15 + a + b
b = c - a
d = "Hello, "
e = "World!"
f = d + e
g = d*a + e
b = "hi!" * b
</pre>

The first few lines are simple if you've worked with any programming language before, but the last few get interesting when combining strings and numbers.

h2. 3. Objects, Attributes, and Methods

In Ruby, everything is an object.  Objects know information, called _attributes_, and they can do actions, called _methods_.  

For an example of an object, think about you as a human being.  You have attributes like height, weight, and eye color.  You have methods like "walk", "run", "wash dishes", and "daydream."  Different kinds of objects have different attributes and methods.  In the next sections we'll look at a few specific kinds of objects common in Ruby.

A class is an *abstract* idea, it defines what all objects of that type can know and do.  Think of the chair you're sitting in.  It's not an abstract chair, it is an actual chair.  We'd call this actual chair an *instance* - it is a realization of the idea chair.  It has measurable attributes like height, color, weight.  The *class* chair, on the other hand, has an abstract weight, color, and size -- we can't determine them ahead of time.

In Ruby we define an object using the @class@ keyword, here's an example defining the object  @PersonalChef@:

<pre class="brush:ruby">
class PersonalChef

end
</pre>

Inside the class we usually define one or more methods using the @def@ keyword like this:

<pre class="brush:ruby">
class PersonalChef
  def make_toast
    puts "Making your toast!"
  end
end
</pre>

Inside the @def@ and @end@ lines we'd put the instructions that the chef should perform when we say @make_toast@.

Once we define a class, we create an @instance@ of that class like this:

<pre class="brush:ruby">
frank = PersonalChef.new
</pre>

We're calling the @new@ method on the class @PersonalChef@ and storing it into the variable named @frank@.  Once we have that instance, we can set or get its attributes and call its methods.  Methods are called by using this syntax: @object.method_name@.  So if you have a person named @frank@ you would tell him to make toast by calling @frank.make_toast@.

h3. Method Parameters

Sometimes methods take one or more _parameters_ that tell them _how_ to do what they're supposed to do.  For instance, I might call @frank.make_toast('burned')@ for him to burn my toast.  Or maybe he has another method where I call @frank.make_breakfast("toast","eggs")@ for him to make both toast and eggs.  Parameters can be numbers, strings, or any kind of object.  When a method takes a parameter it'll look like this:

<pre class="brush:ruby">
class PersonalChef
  def make_toast(color)
    puts "Making your toast #{color}"
  end
end
</pre>

Where the method is expecting us to pass in a @color@ telling it how to do the method @make_toast@.

h3. Return Value

In Ruby, every time you call a method you get a value back.  By default, a Ruby method returns the value of the last expression it evaluated.  If you called the @make_toast@ method above, you should have seen the return value @nil@.  The @puts@ instruction always returns @nil@, so since that was the last instruction in your method you saw @nil@ when calling that method.

For the purposes of our next section I'm going to explicitly return the chef instance itself from the method.  Imagine you are looking at your chef @frank@.  You say "Frank, go make my toast", he tells you he's making the toast, then comes back to you to receive more instructions.  He's "returning" himself to you.  Here's how we implement it in code:

<pre class="brush:ruby">
class PersonalChef
  def make_toast(color)
    puts "Making your toast #{color}"
    return self
  end
end
</pre>

h3. Running Ruby from a File

It's getting annoying to rewrite the @PersonalChef@ class in IRB every time we want to make a change, right?  Let's put it into a text file and run the Ruby code from there.

* Exit your IRB session
* Note which folder your terminal is currently in, this is your "working directory"
* Using a plain-text editor like Notepad, Textmate, or RubyMine, create a file named @personal_chef.rb@ with the contents from the previous section
* Reopen @irb@ from your terminal
* Tell Ruby to load the file with the command @require 'personal_chef'@
* Recreate @frank@ with the line @frank = PersonalChef.new@
* Call the @make_toast@ method by entering @frank.make_toast("light_brown")@

That should work just like it did before when we ran it in IRB.  Now let's make a change to the file by adding in this new method:

<pre class="brush:ruby">
  def make_eggs(quantity)
    puts "Making you #{quantity} eggs!"
    return self
  end
</pre>

Save the file in your editor.  Then we need to tell Ruby to re-read the file.  We can do that with this instruction in IRB:

<pre class="brush:ruby">
  load 'personal_chef.rb'
</pre>

Now try calling @frank.make_eggs(6)@ and it should work.

h3. Method Chaining

Often we'll want to call multiple methods on an object one after the other -- this is called _method chaining_ .  Still thinking about @frank@, we might want to call @make_toast@ and @make_eggs@ one after the other.  We can call multiple methods by using the format @object.method1.method2.method3@.  So for this example, we might say:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
frank.make_toast("burned").make_eggs(6)
</pre>

To read that in Engish, we're telling @frank@ to @make_toast@ with the parameter @burned@, then _after that is completed_ telling him to @make_eggs@ with the parameter @6@.  Try it in your IRB and make sure it works!

h2. 4. Strings

In Ruby a string is defined as a quote (@"@) followed by zero or more letters, numbers, or symbols and followed by another quote (@"@).  Some simple strings would be @"hello"@ or @"This sentence is a string!"@.  Strings can be anything from @""@, the empty string, to really long sets of text.  This whole tutorial, for instance, is stored in a string. Strings have a few important methods that we'll use.

* @length@<br/>Call @length@ on a string to get back the number of characters in the string.  For instance @"hello".length@ would give you back @5@.
* @delete@<br/>Delete lets you specify a set of characters that should be removed from the original string.  For instance, @"hello".delete("l")@ would give you back @"heo"@ after deleting all occurrences of @"l"@, or @"Good Morning!".delete("on")@ would give you @"Gd Mrig"@
* @gsub@<br/>Call @gsub@ to replace a substring with a different string.  For instance, @"hello".gsub("ll","y yo")@ would give you back @"hey yoo"@.
* @split@<br/>The @split@ method is somewhat complex because it's used to break a single string into a set of strings.  For instance, I could call @"Welcome to Ruby".split(" ")@ and it would find the two occurrences of @" "@ (a blank space) and split the string at those points, giving you back a set like this: @["Welcome","to","Ruby"]@

Experiment with the following samples in IRB:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
tester = "Hello Everyone!"
tester.length
tester.delete("o")
tester.gsub("Everyone!","Friends!")
t2 = "sample,data,from,a,CSV"
t2.split(",")
</pre>

Often with strings we want to pull out just a part of the whole -- this is called a substring.  Try out these examples in @irb@ assuming you already have @tester@ from the last examples:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
tester[0..3]
tester[5..11]
tester[13..-1]
</pre>

The numbers inside the @[]@ brackets specify which of the characters you want pulled out.  They're numbered starting with zero.  So the first example pulls out the letters from zero, the beginning of the string, up to position three.  The second example pulls from @5@ up to @11@.  The last one goes from @12@ up to...@-1@?  If you specify a negative value, that is like counting back from the end.  Using @-1@ means the end of the string, so @12..-1@ means "from @12@ to the end of the string."

If you just need a single character, there's a "gotcha" -- it'd be tempting to write @tester[2]@ to get the character at position two.  In the latest versions of Ruby (1.9+) that's exactly how it works.  But in Ruby 1.8, that code will give you back an integer representing the ASCII code for that letter -- pretty useless!  The hack, which works on any version of Ruby, is to take a substring that is only one character long like this: @tester[2..2]@

h3. Combining Strings and Variables

It is extremely common that we want to combine the value of a variable with other strings.  For instance, lets start with this simple example string:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
"Happy Saturday!"
</pre>

When we put that into IRB it just spits back the same string.  If we were writing a proper program we might want it to greet the user when they start the program by saying @"Happy"@ then the day of the week.  So we can't just put a string like @"Happy Saturday!"@ or it'd be saying Saturday even on Tuesday.

What we need to do is combine a variable with the string.  There are two ways to do that.  The first and easiest approach is called _string concatenation_ which is basically just adding strings together like this:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
today = "Saturday"
puts "Happy " + today + "!"
</pre>

In the first line we setup a variable to hold the day of the week, then in the second line we print the string @Happy@ combined with the value of the variable @today@ and the string @!@.  You might be thinking "What was the point of that since we still just wrote Saturday in the first line?"  Ok, well, if you were writing a real program you'd use Ruby's built-in date functions like this:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
require 'date'
today = Date.today.strftime("%A")
puts "Happy " + today + "!"
</pre>

String concatenation works fine most of the time, but there is a gotcha that pops up.  Try this:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
today = Date.today.strftime("%A")
day_of_year = Date.today.yday
puts "Happy " + today + "! It is the " + day_of_year + " day of the year."
</pre>

You should get an error complaining that Ruby "can't convert Fixnum into String".  What does that mean?  When Ruby is assembling the parts of that string it sees a string @"Happy "@, then a string in the variable @today@, then a string with the ! and a few words, then a the variable @day_of_year@, then the string @"day of the year."@.  

The problem is that ruby knows how to add one string to another, but it's not sure how to add a string to a number.  @day_of_year@ contains a number, and when it tries to combine the strings with that number Ruby isn't sure what to do.  Thankfully numbers have a conversion method which converts them into a string so they can be combined with strings.  That method is @.to_s@ for "to string". Retry your example with this slight change:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
today = Date.today.strftime("%A")
day_of_year = Date.today.yday
puts "Happy " + today + "! It is the " + day_of_year.to_s + " day of the year."
</pre>

Great, no errors and our output looks correct.  Having to remember that @.to_s@ whenever you use a number a pain, though.  There is another combination method that forces the "to string" conversion for you called _string interpolation_.

*String interpolation* is the process of sticking data into the middle of strings.  We use the interpolation marker @#{}@ to mark where in a string the value of a variable should be inserted.  Inside those brackets we can put any variables or Ruby code which will be evaluated, converted to a string, and output in that spot.  Our previous example could be rewritten like this:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
puts "Happy #{today}! It is the #{day_of_year} day of the year."
</pre>

If you compare the output you'll see that this second method gives the exact same results.  The code itself is a little more compact and I find it much easier to read.

You can also put any Ruby code or calculations inside the brackets when interpolating like this example:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
modifier = "very "
mood = "excited"
puts "I am #{modifier * 3}#{mood} for today's class!"
</pre>

Basically interpolating means "evaluate the code inside this @#{}@ wrapper and put it into this string".  You can see the first interpolation has a multiplication inside there so it'll repeat the string @modifier@ three times but the second will just plug in the value of the variable @mood@.

h4. Back to Frank

Write a @good_morning@ method on the @PersonalChef@ object that, when called, prints out a message like "Happy Wednesday, it's the 132 day of 2011."

h2. 5. Symbols

Symbols are difficult to explain.  You can recognize a symbol because it starts with a colon then one or more letter like @:flag@ or @:best_friend@.  

Think of it as a stripped down string that has barely any methods and no string interpolation.  Compare the method list for a proper string versus a similar symbol like this:

<pre class="brush:ruby">
  "hello".methods
  "hello".methods.count
  :hello.methods
  :hello.methods.count
</pre>

Symbols are used for passing information around inside our program.  We'd never print a symbol out to a user -- for that we'd use a string.

When starting out with pure Ruby you won't use symbols very frequently.  But when you graduate to Ruby on Rails, they are everywhere.  If you see an object that looks like @:this@, you'll know it's a symbol.  

h2. 6. Numbers

There are two basic kinds of numbers: integers (whole numbers) and floats (have a decimal point).  For most programs you can get away with just integers, and I recommend avoiding floats whenever possible.  Integers are much easier for both you and the computer to work with.

You can use normal math operations with integers including @+@, @-@, @/@, and @*@.  Integers have a bunch of methods to help you do math-related things, which you can see by calling @5.methods@.

h4. Iterating

A common function in *other* languages is the for loop, used to repeat an instruction a set number of times.  An example:

<pre class="brush:plain">
  for(int i=0; i < 5; i++){
    printf "Hello, World"
  }
</pre>

But that's not very readable unless you're familiar with the construct.  In Ruby, because our integers are proper objects, we have the handy @times@ method to repeat an instruction a set number of times.

h4. Revisiting Making Eggs

Let's take another look at Frank's @make_eggs@ method.  We can rebuild it to take advantage of the @times@ method like this:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
def make_eggs(quantity)
  quantity.times do
    puts "Making an egg."
  end
  puts "I'm done!"
  return self
end
</pre>

In this example we're using the @times@ method with a @do@/@end@ block.  When we call the @times@ method we need to tell it what to *do* that number of times.  Ruby looks for the starting keyword @do@ and the ending keyword @end@.  Each instruction between the @do@ and @end@ will be executed this number of @times@.  Try this example with multiple instructions:

Try reloading the file with @load "personal_chef.rb"@ and executing the @make_eggs@ method for @frank@.

h2. 7. Collections

Usually when we're writing a program it's because we need to deal with a *collection* of data.  If you just had one thing, you wouldn't bother!  There are two main types of collections in Ruby: *arrays* and *hashes*.

h4. Arrays

An *array* is a number-indexed list.  Picture a city block of houses.  Together they form an array and their addresses are the *indices*.  Each house on the block will have a unique address.  Some addresses might be empty, but the addresses are all in a specific order.  The *index* is the address of a specific element inside the array.  In Ruby the index always begins with @0@.  An array is defined in Ruby as an opening [, then zero or more elements, then a closing ].  Try out this code:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
meals = ["breakfast","lunch","dinner"]
puts meals[2]
puts meals.first
puts meals.last
</pre>

Keep going with these, but note that the first line below should give you some unusual output.  Try and understand what Ruby is telling you:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
puts meals[3]
meals << "dessert"
puts meals[3]
puts meals
</pre>

In order to get a specific element in the array you use the syntax @arrayname[index]@.  

There are lots of cool things to do with an array.  You can rearrange the order of the elements using the @sort@ method.  You can iterate through each element using the @each@ method.  You can mash them together into one string using the @join@ method.  You can find the address of a specific element by using the @index@ method.  You can ask an array if an element is present with the @include?@ method.  Try adding this method to @PersonalChef@ that manipulates an array:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
def gameplan
  meals.each do |meal|
    puts "We'll have #{meal}..."
  end
  
  all_meals = meals.join(", ")  
  puts "In summary: #{all_meals}"
end
</pre>  

We use arrays whenever we need a list where the elements are in a specific order.

h4. Hashes

A hash is a collection of data where each element of data is addressed by a *name*.  As an analogy, think about a refrigerator.  If we're keeping track of the produce inside the fridge, we don't really care about what shelf it's on -- the order doesn't matter.  Instead we organize things by *name*.  Like the name "apples" might have the value 3, then the name "oranges" might have the value 1, and "carrots" the value 12.  In this situation we'd use a hash.

A hash is an *unordered* collection where the data is organized into "key/value pairs".  Hashes have a more complicated syntax that takes some getting used to:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
produce = {"apples" => 3, "oranges" => 1, "carrots" => 12}
puts "There are #{produce['oranges']} oranges in the fridge."
</pre>

The *key* is used as the address and the *value* is the data at that address.  In the @produce@ hash we have keys including @"apples"@ and @"oranges"@ and values including @12@ and @3@.  When creating a hash the key and value are linked by the @=>@ symbol which is called a _rocket_.  So hashes start with a curly bracket @{@, have zero or more entries made up of a _key_, a rocket, and a _value_ separated by commas, then end with a closing curly bracket @}@.  Try a few more steps:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
produce["grapes"] = 221
produce
produce["oranges"] = 6
produce
produce.keys
produce.values
</pre>

In the first line of those instructions, we add a new value to the hash.  Since the @"grapes"@ key wasn't in the original hash, it's added with the value of @221@.  Keys in the hash *must be unique*, so when we use the same syntax with @produce["oranges"]@ it sees that the key @oranges@ is already in the list and it replaces the value with @6@.  The @keys@ and @values@ methods will also give you just half of the pairs.

h4. Creating an Inventory

Let's write a method for @PersonalChef@ that uses and manipulates a hash:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
def inventory
  produce = {"apples" => 3, "oranges" => 1, "carrots" => 12}
  produce.each do |item, quantity|
    puts "There are #{quantity} #{item} in the fridge."
  end
end
</pre>

That walks through each of the pairs in the inventory, puts the key into the variable @item@ and the value into the variable @quantity@, then prints them out.

h2. 8. Conditionals

Conditional statements evaluate to @true@ or @false@.  The most common conditional operators are @==@ (equal), @>@ (greater than), @>=@ (greater than or equal to), @<@ (less than), and @<=@ (less than or equal to).

Some objects also have methods which return a @true@ or @false@, so they're used in conditional statements.  For example every object has the method @.nil?@ which is @true@ only when the object is @nil@.  Arrays have a method named @.include?@ which returns true if the array includes the specified element.  The convention in Ruby is that a method which returns @true@ or @false@ should have a name ending in a @?@.

h4. Conditional Branching / Instructions

Why do we have conditional statements?  Most often it's to control conditional instructions, especially @if@/@elsif@/@else@ structures.  Let's write an example by adding a method to our @PersonalChef@ class:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
def water_boiling?(minutes)
  if minutes < 7
    puts "The water is not boiling yet."
  elsif minutes == 7
    puts "It's just barely boiling"
  elsif minutes == 8
    puts "It's boiling!"
  else
    puts "Hot! Hot! Hot!"
  end
  return self
end
</pre>

Use @load@ to re-read the file, then try this example using @5@, @7@, @8@ and @9@ for the values of @minutes@.  

When the @minutes@ is 5, here is how the execution goes: "Is it @true@ that 5 is less than 7? Yes, it is, so print out the line @The water is not boiling yet.@".  

When the @minutes@ is 7, it goes like this: "Is it @true@ that 7 is less than 7? No.  Next, is it @true@ that 7 is equal to 7? Yes, it is, so print out the line @It's just barely boiling@".  

When the @minutes@ is 8, it goes like this: "Is it @true@ that 8 is less than 7? No.  Next, is it @true@ that 8 is equal to 7? No. Next, is it @true@ that 8 is equal to 8? Yes, it is, so print out the line @It's boiling!@".  

Lastly, when total is 9, it goes: "Is it @true@ that 9 is less than 7? No.  Next, is it @true@ that 9 is equal to 7? No. Next, is it @true@ that 9 is equal to 8? No. Since none of those are true, execute the @else@ and  print the line @Hot! Hot! Hot!@.

An @if@ block has...
* One @if@ statement whose instructions are executed only if the statement is true
* Zero or more @elsif@ statements whose instructions are executed only if the statement is true
* Zero or one @else@ statement whose instructions are executed if no @if@ nor @elsif@ statements were true

Only _one_ section of the @if@/@elsif@/@else@ structure can have it's instructions run.  If the @if@ is @true@, for instance, Ruby will never look at the @elsif@.  Once one block executes, that's it.

h4. Conditional Looping

We can also repeat a set of instructions based on the truth of a conditional statement.  Try out this simple example by adding it to your @personal_chef.rb@:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
def countdown(counter)
  while counter > 0
    puts "The counter is #{counter}"
    counter = counter - 1
  end
  return self
end
</pre>

See how that works?  The @counter@ starts out as whatever parameter we pass in.  The @while@ instruction evaluates the conditional statement @counter > 0@ and finds that yes, the counter is greater than zero.  Since the condition is @true@, execute the instructions inside the loop.  First print out @"The counter is #{counter}"@ then take the value of @counter@, subtract one from it, and store it back into @counter@.  Then the loop goes back to the @while@ statement.  Is it still @true@? If so, print the line and subtract one again.  Keep repeating until the condition is @false@.

I most often use @while@, but you can achieve the same results using @until@ as well.  Try this...

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
  def countdown(counter)
    until counter == 0
      puts "The counter is #{counter}"
      counter = counter - 1
    end
    return self
  end
</pre>

The #1 mistake people encounter when writing conditional statements is the difference between @=@ and @==@.
* @=@ is an _assignment_.  It means "take what's on the right side and stick it into whatever is on the left side" -- it's _telling_, not _asking_
* @==@ is a _question_.  It means "is the thing on the right equal to the thing on the left?" -- it's _asking_, not _telling_

You can also combine conditional statements using logical operators.  The most common are known as "logical and" and "logical or".  In Ruby you can write a "logical and" with double ampersands like this: @&&@.  You can write a logical or with double pipes like this: @||@. 

h2. 9. Nil & Nothingness

What is nothingness?  Is there nothingness only in outer space?  Really, when we think of "nothing" isn't it just the absence of something?  Ok, that's too much philosophy...

@nil@ is Ruby's way of referring to "nothingness."  

If you have three eggs, eat three eggs, then you might think you have "nothing", but in terms of eggs you have "0".  Zero is something, it's a number, and it's not nothing.  

If you're working with words and have a string like "hello" then delete the "h", "e", "l"s, and "o" you might think you'd end up with nothing, but you really have "" which is an empty string.  It's still something.

@nil@ is Ruby's idea of nothingness.  It's usually encountered when you ask for something that doesn't exist.  When looking at arrays, for instance, we created a list with five elements then asked Ruby to give us the sixth element of that list.  There is no sixth element, so Ruby gave us @nil@.  It isn't that there's a blank in that sixth spot (@""@), it's not a number @0@, it's nothingness -- @nil@.

A large percentage of the errors you encounter while writing Ruby code will involve @nil@.  You thought something was there, you tried to do something to it, and you can't do something to nothing so Ruby creates an error.  Let's rewrite our @make_toast@ method to illustrate @nil@:

<pre class="brush:ruby;">
def make_toast(color)
  if color.nil?
    puts "How am I supposed to make nothingness toast?"
  else
    puts "Making your toast #{color}!"
  end
  return self
end
</pre>

Reload the file, call @frank.make_toast("light brown")@ then try @frank.make_toast(nil)@.  The only method we can rely on @nil@ executing is @.nil?@, pretty much anything else will create an error.
